                        international and local
                        infrastructure projects, particularly in the field of water and wastewater systems. With a
                        combined experience of over 20 years, we have
                        successfully navigated the intricacies of projects falling

                        Environment, Urbanization, and Climate Change.
                        These projects have spanned crucial infrastructure
                        areas such as wastewater treatment plants, drinking
                        water treatment facilities, wastewater collector lines, wastewater pumping stations, drinking
                        water transmission networks, solid waste landfill facilities, and more.</p>
